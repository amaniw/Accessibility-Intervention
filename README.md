This static HTML website, utilizing CSS styling, is designed for CS students to familiarize themselves with screen readers and develop an understanding of empathetic design principles and standards.

Using this site I coded, CS students will have to complete various tasks blindfolded in order to simulate what it is like to have a visual disability. Additionally, the site will be provided as an example for CS students to understand how to design and build a website that is accessible and inclusive.
